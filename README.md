# Deep Learning Specialization from Coursera
Programming assignments in the deep learning courses (in total there are 5 courses as of creating this repo)
Please do not use the code here for cheating, write your own code for solving the assignments.

## Notes on files names
Files names follow this pattern: Cx_Wy_Az_title.py where:
x is number of course, y number of week inside this course and z is number of assignment inside this week and title is just title of the assignment.
List of the courses:
1. C1 or Course 1 is : Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. C2 or Course 2 is : Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3. C3 or Course 3 is : Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. C4 or Course 4 is : Convolutional Neural Networks
5. C5 or Course 5 is : Sequence Models
